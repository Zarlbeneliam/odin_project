                <h3>Timeline of Isaac Newton's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>December 25, 1642</strong> - Isaac Newton is born in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.
                        He is the only son of a yeoman, also named Isaac
                        Newton (who had died three months before), and Hannah Ayscough. Within a couple of years his
                        mother remarries,
                        and young Isaac is sent away by his stepfather, well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, to live with
                        his
                        grandmother.</li>
                    <li><strong>1653</strong> - Upon the death of Smith, Newton and his mother are reunited. His mother
                        later decides that he should manage her
                        property, but he is poorly suited for the job. As a result, he is sent to grammar school in
                        Grantham, England,
                        to prepare for university. He starts to show an aptitude for mechanical and engineering skills,
                        building models
                        of machines, such as clocks and windmills.</li>
                    <li><strong>1661</strong> - Newton begins his undergraduate studies at Trinity College, Cambridge.
                        By this time, the Scientific Revolution
                        is well underway. Astronomers, including Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, had elaborated
                        the
                        heliocentric system of the universe, and Galileo had set a foundation for the mathematical
                        science of motion.
                        However, European universities, including Cambridge, still stress outmoded academic models such
                        as
                        Aristotelianism, which rest on a geocentric view of the universe. Newton studies Aristotle’s
                        work, but he
                        becomes aware of new ideas about science and philosophy.</li>
                    <li><strong>1664</strong> - Newton writes a set of notes, which he entitles “Quaestiones Quaedam
                        Philosophicae” (“Certain Philosophical
                        Questions”). Under this title he pens the slogan “Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend,
                        but my best friend
                        is truth.” The notes reveal that Newton has become thoroughly influenced by the Scientific
                        Revolution. He is
                        intrigued by the work of French natural philosopher René Descartes. He is also influenced by the
                        works of French
                        philosopher and scientist Pierre Gassendi—who had revived atomism, an alternative mechanical
                        system to explain
                        nature—and Irish-born chemist Robert Boyle.</li>
                    <li><strong>1665-67</strong>- Newton receives his bachelor’s degree in 1665, but the mathematical
                        and scientific studies he has undertaken
                        during his undergraduate years are still unknown to the world. The plague descends upon Europe,
                        and Newton has
                        to spend most of the next two years at home, developing the work that he had started at
                        university. In 1667
                        Newton is elected to a fellowship at Trinity College after the university reopens after the
                        plague years.</li>
                    <li><strong>1668</strong> - Newton invents the reflecting telescope.</li>
                    <li><strong>1669-71</strong>Newton becomes a professor of mathematics at Trinity College and writes
                        the tract De Analysi per Aequationes
                        Numero Terminorum Infinitas (“On Analysis by Equations with an Infinite Number of Terms”) in
                        1669. He revises it
                        over the next two years as Tractatus de Methodis Serierum et Fluxionum (“On the Methods of
                        Series and
                        Fluxions”). Newton’s term fluxions is the original term for derivatives. During this period
                        Newton begins to
                        lecture on the work he has done in optics.</li>
                    <li><strong>1672</strong> - Newton sends a paper on light and colors to the Royal Society. The paper
                        is generally well received, though some
                        dissent is voiced and one of the society’s leaders, Robert Hooke, writes a critique of it.
                        Newton has an
                        unusually negative reaction to the criticism and eventually withdraws into virtual isolation.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1684–87</strong> - Toward the end of 1684 Newton sends a short tract entitled De Motu
                        (“On Motion”) to British astronomer Edmond
                        Halley. Newton continues to improve and expand this work and in 1687 publishes the landmark
                        Philosophiae
                        Naturalis Principia Mathematica, (The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). One of the
                        fundamental
                        works of modern science, it sets forth his three basic laws of motion and law of universal
                        gravitation.</li>
                    <li><strong>1696</strong> - Newton is appointed warden of the mint and moves to London (although he
                        does not resign from Cambridge until
                        1701). As warden of the mint and, soon after, master of the mint, in charge of issuing currency,
                        Newton oversees
                        the replacement of currency with new coins and relishes his authority in catching
                        counterfeiters.</li>

                    <li><strong>1703</strong> -
                        Newton is elected president of the Royal Society.</li>

                    <li><strong>1704</strong> -
                        Newton publishes the first edition of Opticks, a work summarizing his research in light and
                        colors.</li>

                    <li><strong>1705</strong> -
                        Queen Anne knights Newton, the first time a scientist receives the honor.</li>

                    <li><strong>March 20, 1727</strong> -
                        Newton dies in London, England, and is buried at Westminster Abbey.</li>
